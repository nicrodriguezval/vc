## Optical illusion
Color effect caused by fatigue of the retina, we have three types of cones in our eyes, which are sensitive to light waves related to the colors red, green and blue, when we expose them to large amounts of light they fatigue and they do not respond temporarily, then we will see the colors of the fatigued cones for a few seconds, this allows us to see a black and white image in color.
In the gif below, I looked at the black dot.
