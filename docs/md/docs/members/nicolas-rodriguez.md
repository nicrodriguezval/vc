## Bio
My name's Nicolás, I'm 21 years old, I'm in my fourth year of IT Engineering, I live with my father, sister and stepmother. I love my career to the point spend almost the whole time learning new stuff about it, the main reason for that is 'cause I actually enjoy it. I hope to get my degree in about a year.

## Interests
Software Architecture, Machine Learning and Cryptography.

## Contributions
Graphic and logical part in [AirlineTicketsApplication](https://github.com/nicrodriguezval/AirlineTicketsApplication), Front-end in [UnWallet](https://github.com/un-ingesoftII-grupo6) [web page](http://un-wallet-app.herokuapp.com/), user management microservice and Front-end in [Geosmart app](https://github.com/GEGOSMART), several personal projects using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).


## Hobbies
In my free time I like programming, research and learn about new technologies, listen to almost all kinds of music, spend time with my family, hang out with my friends, play videogames, watch TV series and films, improve my pronunciation, listening comprehension, and grammar in English.

## Illusion

### Ludimar Hermann

Ludimar Hermann was born in Berlin, Germany on October 31, 1838. He was a great physiologist and speech scientist who contributed much in physiology and phonetic fields. He died in Königsberg, Russian on June 5, 1914.

### Hermann grid illusion

This illusion was reported for the first time in scientific literature by Ludimar Hermann, it occurs because the high contrast black mixed with withe lines (or vice versa as we'll see in a moment) trick the eyes, they send a signal to the brain perceiving a gray circle at each intersection. The classical explanation of the physiological mechanism was provided by Baumgartner in 1960. This kind of illusion is called *simultaneous lightness contrast illusion* by the scientists.

Sometimes this illusion is called **Hermann-Hering illusion** this is because the German physiologist Ewald Hering noted that the same Illusion occurs when the squares are white and the lines black.
