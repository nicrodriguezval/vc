## Illusion

### Hermann grid

This illusion was reported for the first time in scientific literature by Ludimar Hermann a German physiologist and speech scientist who lived between 1838 and 1914.

The illusion occurs because the high contrast black mixed with withe lines (or vice versa as we'll see in a moment) trick the eyes, they send a signal to the brain perceiving a gray circle at each intersection.

Sometimes this illusion is called **Hermann-Hering illusion** this is because the German physiologist Ewald Hering noted that the same Illusion occurs when the squares are white.
