# Bio
I was born in Tunja, Boyaca in 1998, I always lived in the same house with my mother, father, my aunt and my pets, and always was interested in how the computers worked internally. Being able to be a student in the National University of Colombia was an unexpected event when I was a highschooler, but this had bringed to me the opportunity to being in constant learning both important professional skills in the Systems Engineering career and my personal interests, with the guidance from some of the best prepared and skillful teachers in the country. I keep learning from their experiences everyday.

Most likely my goal is to make a contribution in the way things are done in my country, in the technologic aspect, streamlining some of the bureaucracy to improve the quality life of the people that have to do goverment procedures, or that simply would like to have a better way to share their products, thoughts and interests independently on the web.

# Ilussion 

This type of image, that simulates movement in the exterior circles, is called [**peripheral drift illusion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_drift_illusion) (PDI). This particular design was made by Paul Nasca, where we can appreciate the sawtooth like segments inside the circle, which could trick the luminance processing in our brains, triggering the motion perception system without having actual movement in the image. One of the best ways to easily see this type of illusion is to look to some point out of the image, and start blinking as fast as possible.

## Rotating snakes

The first mention of PDI in literature was on the work of [Faubert and Herbert in 1999](http://brain.phgy.queensu.ca/pare/assets/Faubert%20Herbert%201999.pdf), but a similar type of illusion called "escalator illusion" was present since 1979. Nowadays there is a large variety of different kinds of PDI, one of the most famous is the "rotating snakes" illusion, developed by Professor Akiyoshi Kitaoka in 2003, in which the circular pattern shown below resembles coiled snakes, and it appears that this snakes are moving around in circles.

## Discussion

However, no one is quite sure how this motion illusions works. It was described in the work of Antis and Rogers (1974) that a bright spot appearing and fading at some point in the visual field, will create a sense of motion from the dark to white stimulus. If you put close attention to the patterns in the snakes illusion image, you will notice that the patterns of some are reversed, explaining why some snakes rotate in different directions. When the gaze is not fixed in one single point, the signal from the visual field changes a bit because of small involuntary movements of the eye, and this may play an important role triggering the illusion.
