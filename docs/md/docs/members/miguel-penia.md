## Bio
Being able to be a student in the National University of Colombia was an unexpected event when I was a highschooler, but this had bringed to me the opportunity to being in constant learning both important professional skills in the Systems Engineering career and my personal interests, with the guidance from some of the best prepared and skillful teachers in the country. I keep learning from their experiences everyday.

Most likely my goal is to make a contribution in the way things are done in my country, in the technologic aspect, streamlining some of the bureaucracy to improve the quality life of the people that have to do goverment procedures, or that simply would like to have a better way to share their products, thoughts and interests independently on the web.
